<h2>Adapting a Patterson-type reel for large-format films </h2>

<p><i>by Don Day (donday at bga dot com)</i></p>

<p>You can adapt a standard Patterson-type reel (the white
plastic reels
that slide onto a "bouncing" center post) for films larger
than the standard 120 size. The secret: a cheap and lowly 1 1/4"
plastic drain pipe adapter from your hardware store! </p>

<p>This project assumes that you have a two-reel version of the
tank, since
we are making up a larger reel and will need the extra capacity of
the two-reel tank for processing larger rolls. </p>

<p>Here is what
to shop for--a standard bathroom sink drain pipe extension (1 1/4"
marked diameter) that should cost no more than a couple dollars. <br>

</p>

<p>This
is a tube about 6" long with a small reducing section about 2"
from one end, and usually comes with plastic compression rings and a
threaded coupler. Buy several so that you can make spares for other
film sizes. These also make great telescope eyepiece adapters, but
THAT project is for another forum, another community. </p>

<p>You will also need a "nibbling tool." Radio Shack sells these
for trimming metal project boxes to mount meters or cut holes larger
than your drill bits can handle. Each pinch of this tool removes a
small rectangle of material about 3/16" wide and 1/8" long
at a time. We'll use this to dig out the channels for the adapter to
interlock with the reels. There is no better tool for the job. I got
frustrated trying to use hacksaws, coping saws, Dremel bits, metal
shears, you name it. This tool does the job so fast that you can
easily overdo it! </p>

<h3>122 adapter</h3>

<p>First, let's make the easy one--an adapter for
122-size film. This was the size used for the very common Kodak 3A
cameras, therefore there is a chance that you might use this adapter
once in a while. </p>

<p>Use a hacksaw to cut off the threaded end at
about 1 1/4" from the reducing section of the pipe. Sand off any
plastic burrs. </p>

<p>From the reducer, measure out about 1 1/8"
or 1 1/4" onto the narrow part of the tube, and again cut and
deburr that edge. </p>

<p>The big end of the adapter should just
slide over the narrow half of the film spool. You guessed it--the
narrow end of the adapter will go into the larger film spool hole.</p>

<p>Place 3 equally-spaced guide marks around the narrow part of
the adapter. From the edge of the reducer, measure back 1/2" at
each guide mark. Now, at each guide mark, use the nibbling tool to
cut a channel from the end of the narrow tube up to the 1/2"
mark. Fit the channels to the matching reel to test the fit as you
go. </p>

<p>You can now assemble the pieces, slide the assembly onto
the black central tube, and use the snap ring to keep the assembly
together. Done! </p>

<p>For extra credit, there is ample room around
the narrow end of the tube to put two more sets of channels. In this
photo, you can see one set that I added for 130 film, with space left
for another format that I'll dig out once I know which film it is!
Three for one, not bad for a 3 dollar adapter. </p>

<h3>70mm (116/616) adapter</h3>

<p>This adapter involves modifying the end of
one of your reel halves. </p>

<p>Trim off the large end of the drain
pipe as before. Trim off the narrow end at 1/2" from the
reducing section. On the narrow end, mark off and even up the
equidistant thirds as before. Use the nibbling tool to cut the
channels up to the reducer. If you wish, you can also nibble in some
catch bays to lock the reducer onto it matching reel half, although
this is not necessary.</p>

<p>Now for the modification to your other
reel half. If you have the two-reel tank, you can dedicate one reel
for the 70mm adapter and leave the other reel to handle any other
size. The part that you trim off for the 70mm conversion will throw
off the adapter used for 122 or any other large film. </p>

<p>This modification is straightforward. You need to cut off the
end of the
center post down to the depth of the alignment notch on the reel.</p>

<pre>____ ____<br> |__| &lt;- trim down to this point </pre>

<p>Before you trim,
mark the location of the notch with a permanent marker so that you
can continue to align the reel parts for your other film processing.
This cut determines how closely the reels fit together--without it,
the gap is too wide for 70mm film, too much taken off and the film
might become hard to load due to binding along the edges. </p>

<p>At this point, once you reassemble the reel parts on the
adapter and
secure them on the black central tube with the pinch ring, the new
spacing should be very close to the 70mm needed for 116/616 films.</p>

<p>In that last photo, you can see that I added nylon screws
to give this adapter the same "snap on" behavior as the
reels. After all that work, I decided it was not worth it since the
basic problem of spacing has already been solved, and the plastic
pinch ring is enough to keep the assembly together.</p>
