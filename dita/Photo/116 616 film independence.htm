<p>Assuming that you have at
least two spare spools for either the 116 (wide flange) or 616 (narrow
flange) film formats, here is how you can roll your own reloads using
readily available 70mm bulk film.</p>


<p>
Film in the 70mm width used to be very popular. It is the usual size
for portrait cameras, and is also a natural size for use on 6x6
high-end systems like Hasselblad. &nbsp;Kodak and other
manufacturers sold a range of emulsions in both double-perforated and
unperforated sizes. &nbsp;With the shift of the portrait market to
digital, much of the former market for 70mm film has become
unprofitable for suppliers. &nbsp;Most sources today of 70mm film
are either past-expiration rolls on eBay or a limited number of
emulsions still available. &nbsp;For color photography, the most
easily available type is Portra 160 (C-41 process).&nbsp; For black
and white photography,&nbsp;JandC Photography offers a 30 meter
roll of 70mm Adox (formerly Efke) 100.</p>


<p>Reloads for 116/616 rolls are 1 meter or 39 inches in length.
It's easiest to just mark this distance with bits of masking tape on a
bench or table in your darkroom to help you find the right cutting
location for one strip.&nbsp; Each 1-meter reload has
about the same surface area&nbsp;as two 24 exposure rolls of 35mm
film.</p>


<p>
The old 116/616 cameras usually come with an empty spool. Spools sold
individually on eBay can go for as much as a cheap Pocket Kodak that
has a
spool in it, so you may as well "shop for a spool that comes with a
free camera."</p>


<p>
Once in awhile you'll get a partially used roll in a camera. Vendors
almost always pop the back open so they can take a picture of the roll
in place --"Comes with film!" they advertise, mindless of the loss of
whatever images had been taken and any future use you might get from
the remaining exposures. You should still try developing the old film
just to see what might turn up (HC110 recommended for cutting fog), but
keep your
expectation of "lost image recovery" at about 30% or less, thanks to
mindless middlemen (I'm not even really ranting yet). At any rate, if
the camera came with an original roll, you will get
a paper that you can reuse. In my opinion, this paper will be more
valuable as a
pattern later on than as a reload for now.</p>


<p>
To keep from ruining the paper/tape joint through repeated handling in
the dark, I suggest using painting tape to attach the film on the
paper.
Regular masking tape is stronger than necessary for adhering the film
to the paper; you need only enough
tack to keep things together given the moderate drag within the camera.
In fact, I use a full width of the blue painting tape for the paper
side of the
joint, and add a strip of the even less tacky purple painting tape for
actually
attaching the film (squint at this edge view--copy into Notepad if it
does not look right here):</p>


<pre style="border: 1px inset ; margin: 0px; padding: 6px; overflow: auto; width: 640px; height: 98px;">3/4" blue tape (1/2 on the paper, 1/2 backs the purple tape strip)<br> | <br> v    // &lt;- 1/2" purple tape strip backed by the blue tape<br>_____//_______  &lt;- film (held by purple tape only)<br>--------------- &lt;- paper</pre>


<p>
Even if you don't find a camera with paper, with patience you can find
used spools with paper on eBay. Whichever way you get your backing
paper, the
papers have a limited lifetime for reuse. Old cameras never seem to
track cleanly, and the paper often will skew to the side and get
mangled along the edge during use. Once the light leaks become
objectionable, its time for the last piece in the plan--backing paper
replacements.</p>


<p>
A perfect paper for replacement film backing is available from Cartoon
Colour. Go to <a href="http://www.cartooncolour.com/catalog" target="_blank">http://www.cartooncolour.com/catalog</a>
and search for "exeter". The 25ft minimum length for about $40 will
slice into dozens of backing papers. Each 69" length will yield about 9
backing papers, carefully slit in a pivot-bladed paper cutter. Your
hobby/art store will have a DecoColor opaque paint marker that is
perfect for adding numbers to each of your new backing papers (copying
off that original, well-worn roll). Plus, this paper seems tougher than
original film papers--you should get multiple reuses from each. This
will last you til kingdom come, but don't count it a waste--look at the
figures:</p>


<p>
Although the initial outlay seems like you are starting your own film
factory, the<i> first-time</i>
cost per roll (no reuse of the paper) amortizes to about $3.50 each (30
reloads from that 30m bulk roll, including the special paper order, ink
pen, and tape). Weigh that against the special-order commercial
equivalents that cost nearly 10 times as much! But that's not all!--
you also get the thrill of using sharp blades in the dark. ;-) </p>
